Arises between people who perceive that there are incompatible goals or not enough resources in a situation or relationship. ;; conflict

communication strategies we use to handle conflict ;; conflict management styles

Each style is designed to do one of two things in a conflict:
,,
- Help you meet your personal goals, also known as self-goals.
- Help you meet another person's goals, or other-goals.

# Conflict Styles

Want to steer clear of the discomfort of communicating directly. ;; avoidant style

avoidant style has a low concern for ==self-goals and other-goals==

when people repeat a behavior that bugs us and we don't address it, our frustration and the intensity of the conflict can build up over time ;; gunnysacking

involves a high concern for self-goals and a Iow concern for other-goals. ;; competing styles

In order to come out on top in a conflict, people who adopt the competing style use their power in ==noncoercive or coercive ways==

involves a Iow concern for self-goals and a high concern for other-goals. ;; accommodating style

Tries to meet both self-goals and other-goals. In this approach, people work to find a middle ground by conceding some points to others. ;; compromising style

People work together to address everyone's concerns ;; collaborating style

Research shows that how we define self-goals and how we perceive other goals during conflict largely depends on how our culture perceives the concept of ==face==.

According to face negotiation theory, face refers to the ==projected self we want to show to the world==.

Refers to the communicative strategies we use to maintain, repair, or challenge our face or another person's face. ;; facework
