determines which operator would be evaluated first if they were all in the same expression. Associative can be left or right and determines which operator would be evaluated first if operators with the same precedence were next to each other.;;Operator precedence and operator associativity.

An operator with a single operand;;Unary operator

An operator that appears in between their operands.;;Infix operator

Operator usually has left associativity;;+

they are separated by a single operand.;;Adjacent operators

Associativity rules are used by Java;;Left to right

A parenthesized part of an expression has precedence over its adjacent unparenthesized parts.;;Parentheses affect the precedence rule

An operator that has more than one use.;;Overload Operator

A ____ conversion converts a value to a type that cannot store even approximations of all of the values of the original type. A widening conversion converts a value to a type that can include at least approximations of all of the values of the original type.;;Narrowing and widening conversions

an expression that allows its operand to have different types;;Mixed-mode expression

semantics of programs are much easier to understand being that functions are equivalent to a mathematical function.;;Advantages of referential transparency

An expression in which the result is determined without evaluating all of the operands and/or operators;;Short-circuit evaluation

To act as a shorthand method of specifying the form of assignment where the destination variable also appears as the first operand in the expression on the right side.;;Purpose of a compound assignment operator

The associativity of C's unary arithmetic operators;;Right to left

Languages include multiple assignments;;Perl and Ruby

Are mixed-mode assignments are allowed in ML;;NO

an explicit conversion of data types of operands by programmers;;Cast
